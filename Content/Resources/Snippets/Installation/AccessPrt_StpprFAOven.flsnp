        <p>Verify the port stopper is installed in the oven access port. The chamber oven will not meet its temperature performance specifications without the stopper installed.</p>
        <p>The stopper must always be installed on the outside of the oven. Installing the stopper on the inside of the oven risks damaging the stopper.</p>
        <p>The intended use of the port is to introduce sensor probes into the oven chamber.</p>
