        <h2>Reference Sensor Devices</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Emphasis_10">Must be purchased separately</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Reference sensor devices or a combined device are required for calibrating the incubator temperature and CO<sup>2</sup> displays.</p>
        <p>Reference devices must meet the following standards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accurate to at least 0.1°C</li>
            <li>	Accurate to at least 0.1% CO¬2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The devices should be regularly calibrated, preferably by a third party.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Emphasis_10">Temperature Probes</p>
        <p>For temperature, use a digital device with wire thermocouple probes that can be introduced into the incubation chamber through the unit access port. Select thermocouples suitable for the application temperature you will be calibrating at.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Emphasis_10">CO<sup>2</sup> Sampling</p>
        <p>For best CO<sup>2</sup> accuracy, use a digital gas analyzer with sample tubing connecting to the incubator CO<sup>2</sup> sample port. The barbed adapter gas fitting on the port connects to 3/16-inch (4.76mm) inner diameter (ID), 5/16-inch (7.94mm) outside diameter (OD) tubing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Emphasis_10">Why Probes and Tubing?</p>
        <p>Reference readings taken outside the chamber using wire temperature probes and CO<sup>2</sup> drawn through the sample port avoid chamber door openings. Openings disrupt the chamber temperature and CO<sup>2</sup> concentration level. Each disruption requires a minimum 1-hour wait to allow the atmosphere to re-stabilize before continuing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Emphasis_10">No Alcohol or Mercury Thermometers</p>
        <p>Alcohol thermometers do not have sufficient accuracy to conduct accurate temperature calibrations. Never place a mercury thermometer in the incubation chamber! Always use thermocouple probes.</p>
